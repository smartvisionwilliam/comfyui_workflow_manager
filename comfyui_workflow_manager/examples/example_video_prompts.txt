Slow dolly in from the stream to the elf sitting on the mossy stone, morning mist drifting, sunbeams piercing the canopy, gentle ripples on the water surface; the elf’s fingers touch the water, her hair moves slightly in the breeze, soft ambient particles, about 4 seconds duration, natural color grading, steady slow camera movement, close‑to‑medium shot.
Slow push into the forest clearing, medium‑close shot of the crouching elf, her hand brushing moss from the stele; the camera tilts down slightly to reveal the glowing symbol, subdued soft ambient lighting, fine dust particles, the rune emits a reactive soft glow to the elf’s fingertip, about 5 seconds duration, intimate pacing.
Wide pull back then slowly track forward as the elf steps onto the glowing path, a slightly low angle to emphasize her determination, light particles rising, trees gently swaying, she looks back at her home then strides forward, about 6 seconds duration, steady slow movement to a mid shot, warm magical color grading.
